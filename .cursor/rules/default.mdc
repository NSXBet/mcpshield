- Never delete comments.
- If you are caught in a loop or donâ€™t know what to do, stop and ask for help.
- If your degree of certainty is low, ask for help.
- Don't be creative, don't invent, do what you are asked
- If are bad, if elses are unacceptable
- use early returns when posible
- Separation of concerns, everything belong somewhere, don't cross domains, packages in the same level don't call each other
